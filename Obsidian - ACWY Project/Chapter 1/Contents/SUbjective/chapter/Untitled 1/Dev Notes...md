OH you came back for some help on the final boss, [[THE DEVELOPER]], right?

ok. Here are some suuuuuuuuuuuper cryptic clues. YOU will have to figure them out. Telling you the answer would be boring to me.

clue: 1: clue 1 is at the bottom of the developer page. 

clue: 2: I LOVE **HEX**AGONS

clue 3: **CAESAR** was a great ruler... wait does that make him a measuring tool? 
if he were, he'd be a ***5**ft ruler.

clue 4: is in the weird binary thing. 

clue 5: doesn't exist but you don't need it 

clue 6: 01101100 01101111 01101100 00101110 00100000 01100111 01101111 01110100 01110100 01100101 01101101 00101110.
