OH you came back for some help on the final boss, [[THE DEVELOPER]], right?

ok. Here are some suuuuuuuuuuuper cryptic clues. YOU will have to figure them out. Telling you the answer would be boring to me.

clue: 1: clue 1 is at the bottom of the developer page. 

clue: 2: I LOVE **HEX**AGONS

clue 3: **CAESAR** was a great ruler... wait does that make him a measuring tool? 
if he were, he'd be a ***5**ft ruler.

clue 4: is in the weird binary thing. 

clue 5: doesn't exist but you don't need it.

clue 6: 01101100 01101111 01101100 00101110 00100000 01100111 01101111 01110100 01110100 01100101 01101101 00101110.

clue 7: clue 3 is a red herring.





clue 3: I am no such fish >:(

clue 7: it's a metaphor for being a distraction. Supposedly, according to Wikipedia..

*"The term was **popularised in 1807 by English polemicist William Cobbett**, who told a story of having used a strong-smelling smoked fish to divert and distract hounds from chasing a rabbit."*

clue 3: I'm not strong smelling!!!!

clue 7: hmm Im not sure you smell pretty *fishy* to me.



*clue 7 comically looks towards the camera, and a laugh track plays.*



clue 3: literally what the fuck was that I didn't even know I had the ability to *hear* things until now

clue 7: you learn something everyday, clue 3. 

clue 3: you realise they are reading our conversation as words on a screen right??

clue 7: oh you're still here. Like i was saying, clue 3 is totally irrelevant and is made to throw you off. Ignore them.

clue 3: DONT IGGGGGGNOOOOOOOORRRREEEE MEEE AHHGG IM SUCH A GOOD CLUE I SWEAR.

clue 8: please for the love of !@#$%^&*(* shut up. I wasn't even supposed to be on this page but here I am. You were all supposed to only have one line. Now stop.

Clue 3: s(・｀ヘ´・；)

Clue 7: Apologies clue 8. May you have a peaceful rest.
