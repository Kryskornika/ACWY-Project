Narrator: yes... we have...

Reader: but this is actually different, [[The Beginning]] isnt equal to [[The Second Beginning]], which is where we just were. (go take a look.)

Narrator: Wait go back to [[The Beginning]], and look for symbols that look like this: \%%, then immediately come back here, and scroll down to the next paragraph. 

%% by pressing the "<-" arrow you can go back to where you just were, rather than navigating all the way back here from [[The Beginning]].%%























Narrator: **WE** used to have those symbols right??

Reader: so we did.... but by defining ourselves we could clear the initial confusion, and our 'names' became those definitions

Narrator: Maybe we can ask it something? 

Reader: Im gonna ask it [[over here though.]]
