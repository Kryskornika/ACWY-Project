??: I know. They mean the following. I'll put it in an ordered list so you can understand.

%% Click the arrow of an ordered list to expand / collapse it.%%
### Ordered list 
- RN - **Right now...**  *Is what is happening at this very moment, in my opinion*
- NGL - **Not gonna lie?**  *this is a double negative. This means whenever Im saying "NGL", Im telling the truth as i see it?*
- IDEK - **I Don't even know...** * Im admitting that **I DON'T KNOW** what this means yet*
