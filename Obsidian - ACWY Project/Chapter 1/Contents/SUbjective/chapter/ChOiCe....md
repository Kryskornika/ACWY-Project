Narrator: you literally just chose something. Are you happy now?

Player: both those lead to the same thing. AND it didn't even effect the **OUTCOME** of what happened!!!! what kinda choice was that?????

Narrator: ok, here, have a  "[[ChOiCe... | choice]]" then.  Have 3 Choices that "effect the story. And a few others that don't."

[[ok, i get the idea. You can stop.]]

Choice 1: [[The Beginning]]

Choice 2: [[THINK ABOUT AN IDEA AND WHERE I WANT IT TO BE]]

Choice 48932: [[I am nothing but a distraction. DO NOT CLICK ME]]

Choice #&$&*?*: [[Dev Notes..| This choice doesn't effect the story, but it might change how you look at the story.... probably don't come here yet. Go elsewhere first, then come back here last.]]
