# ACWY-Project

this is a little idea i had at like 3am and then it kept me up for the rest of the night.

# Installation:

- This project uses obsidian ((https://obsidian.md/)) and explores the ideas within it. 
- For the best experience open this using obsidian. 

- Once opened, click the little keyhole looking icon, located above the ? symbol. 

- Click 'open folder as vault'

- Navigate to where you have saved the project and open it :)

- Enjoy!
